# Pointers vs Values
Pointers and values, what they are and their differences are important to understanding day to day code in Go.  
In some cases it is a "Best Practice" or "convention" to use pointers (such as "pointer receivers"), but in another context it is not.

## Pointers
// TODO: when are variables passed using a pointer, also in context of maps, slices, etc

## Values
// TODO: when are variables passed by value, also in context of maps, slices, etc

## Receivers
// TODO: describe receivers and difference between a **pointer** receiver and **value** receiver
